The bookkeeping of the exported matches to CBG is collected in the table MATCHES_CBG_WWW. 
In order to create such a table in the links_match db: 
	$ mysql -u links -p links_match < MATCHES_CBG_WWW.schema.sql

The Python script to export the matches for a given id_match_process value is: 
	export_matches.py

The script requires several extra python modules not present in the system python. 
We prefer the use of 'virtual' pythons, to which we added the needed modules, see 
virtual-python-3.5.2.txt. 
In order to automatically activate the virtual python, the python script is 
started via a tiny shell script: 
	$ cd /data/links/match/export_matches
	$ ./export_matches.sh

In github, you can find these and other scripts in 
links/LinksProject/src/main/python
